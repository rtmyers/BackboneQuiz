# BackboneQuiz

A simple test application for Backbone employment consideration. 

The first repo for this was accidentally created privately, so I've re-deployed it in this public repo.

To start using this application : 

1) git clone https://github.com/rtmyers/BackboneQuiz.git

2) cd BackboneQuiz && npm run build-and-start
